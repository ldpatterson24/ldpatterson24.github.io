My Elevator Pitch is as following

Iâ€™m an information science major at UALR, eager to continue to educate myself in the field. Currently slated to graduate in May 2022 and would prefer Front End Development positions. I always wanted to be involved with technology and design, so I feel like Front End Development would be a great field for me to fulfill my purpose. 

Currently enrolled in University of Arkansas - Fayetteville, Front end development certification program.
