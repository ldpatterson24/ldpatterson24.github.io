## Welcome to LeDarius' Pages
My Elevator Pitch is as following

I’m an information science major at UALR, eager to continue to educate myself in the field. Currently slated to graduate in May 2022 and would prefer Front End Development positions. I always wanted to be involved with technology and design, so I feel like Front End Development would be a great field for me to fulfill my purpose. 

Currently enrolled in University of Arkansas - Fayetteville, Front end development certification program.
